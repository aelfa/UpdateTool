             |The following environment variables must be set and exported before launching this tool successfully!
             |  PLEX_DATA_DIR: Used for the data directory of plex
             |
             | The following environment variables are optional and enhance the tool in certain ways.
             |
             | (Optional) UNLOCK_FOR_NEW_TV_AGENT: Used to specify the library IDs with the new TV Show agent which should be processed by UpdateTool 
             |            This will potentially override all TMDB/TVDB ratings with IMDB ratings!
             | (Optional) TMDB_API_KEY: Used to convert TMDB matched items to IMDB items. The fallback will only be available if this is set.
             | (Optional) TVDB_API_KEY: Used to auth with the TVDB API.
             | (Optional) IGNORE_LIBS: Ignore libraries from being touched by this tool by supplying a set of library ids as a semicolon ';' seperated string.
             |            Example: Ignoring 1 => IGNORE_LIBS=1 | Ignoring 1, 2, 3 => IGNORE_LIBS=1;2;3
             | (Optional) CAPABILITIES: Specify special settings for the tool. Must be entered as a ';' seperated string.
             |            Currently available: [NO_TV, NO_MOVIE]
             |            Example: NO_TV;NO_MOVIE => renders this tool useless
             | (Optional) OVERRIDE_DATABASE_LOCATION: Override the path where the Plex database is stored.
             |            Useful for example if the PLEX_FOLDER/Plug-in Support/Databases folder structure is violated (Docker Volumes i.e.).
             |            Example: OVERRIDE_DATABASE_LOCATION=/volume1/@appstore/PlexMediaServer/Resources (uses DB in Resources folder).
             | (Optional) USE_PLEX_SQLITE_BINARY_FOR_WRITE_ACCESS: Use Plex's non-standard custom build of SQLite3 for write access.
             |            Useful for users that experience corruption of their database with UpdateTool.
             |            This must point to the SQLite binary that is in the main Plex folder (next to the server binary).
